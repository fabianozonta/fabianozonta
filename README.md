<p align="left">My name is Fabiano Zonta and With over 10 years of experience in IT support and technical expertise, I have developed a strong foundation in troubleshooting, system maintenance, and user support. Over the past three years, I have enhanced my skills by studying Python and SQL, gaining proficiency in scripting, automation, and database management.

For the past year, I have been focused on cybersecurity, deepening my knowledge in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and ethical hacking. I am actively seeking an opportunity to transition into the cybersecurity field as an Analyst or Pentester, where I can apply my technical expertise to protect and secure digital environments.</p>
